# Bifurcated Auto Encoder based on Attention Mechanism
1 - Implementation of a network for segmentation of covid-19 infected regions in CT-images. 
2 - A method based on generative models for generating synthetic infected regions.

Different part of the network:
- Encoder
- Decoder
- Inception Block
- Channel-wise Attention 
- Spatial-wise Attention
- Attention Fusion

## Architecture
The overall architecture of the network is shown below:
